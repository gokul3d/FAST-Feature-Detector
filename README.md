FAST Feature Detection
Overview
This project demonstrates FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) feature detection in computer vision. FAST is an efficient algorithm for detecting keypoints in images.

Contents
fast_feature_detection.py:

Python script showcasing FAST feature detection.
Loads an image, converts it to grayscale, applies FAST feature detection, and visualizes the keypoints.
Sample Image:

ivy.jpeg: Sample image used for demonstrating FAST feature detection.
Replace this image with your own for custom experiments.
How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (cv2, matplotlib, numpy).
Run the fast_feature_detection.py script.
Observe the output displaying the original image with FAST keypoints marked.
Results
The output of the script will be a visualization of the original image with FAST keypoints marked. Adjust the FAST threshold and experiment with different images to observe the algorithm's behavior.

Feel free to utilize, modify, or contribute to this project for your feature detection applications.
